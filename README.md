# databases_evaluation_project_old

This project is an older version of a class evaluation system, which was an academic project for a Databases course.

This system allows both students and professors to log in to access the system. For all of the courses they are enrolled in, students can view already-closed evaluations on their homepage, as well as complete or edit evaluations that are still currently open. 

Professors can add evaluation sessions for a course, as well as see the data for each evaluation session. Student evaluations are anonymous, so the Professor cannot see who submitted the evaluations. 

The ability for a Professor to create a course and add students to the course, has not been implemented, as the project requirements have changed during project development, which resulted in the project being rebuilt from scratch (hence the "old" at the end of this project name). For testing purposes, courses and students were managed using the built-in Django shell, or the built-in Django admin panel.
